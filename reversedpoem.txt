Today was a very good day
And you'll never in a million years hear me say
It's all beyond my control
My attitude
Creates
The reality
I'm sure you can agree that
It's not true that good exists
Only if one's surroundings are good
True happiness can be attained
Because
It's all in the mind and heart
And it's not true that
Satisfaction and happiness don't last.
Some goodness does shine through once in a while
Even if
This world is a pretty evil place.
Because, when you take a closer look,
There's something good in every day
And don't try to convince me that
Today was the absolute worst day ever
